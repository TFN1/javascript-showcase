            My last piece of code is an endless interactive artwork created by the user. 
            The idea is an infinite multi-coloured linework created by the user in real time.
            This piece of code shows interactivity through both key and mouse actions used to move and change the colour of the 'square' as it leaves a trail.
            This final piece shows a continuation of learning into the interactivity space.
