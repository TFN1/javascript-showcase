        <h2>Animation Notes</h2>
        <p>
            The idea of a square rolling down a series of stairs was an early decision but took sometime to create. 
            The main exploration took place through the rotation of the cube and then moving this rotation point to create the animation. 
            This piece of code shows an ability to create original, animated code within P5 as well as a progression of understanding seen in the use of while, for and if loops.
